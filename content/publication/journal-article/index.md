abstract: Introduction: Social distancing and sheltering-in-place mitigate the physical health risks of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19); however, there are concerns about the impact on mental health and social engagement. Methods: We used data from a U.S.-based online survey (March 2020) to examine patterns of social support and prosocial behavior, explore differences between people with and without depression or anxiety, and explore correlates of social engage- ment in both groups, including symptom severity in the clinical group. Results: The clinical group reported greater social engagement. In both groups, social engagement was positively associated with COVID-19-related worry and trait moral elevation; mindfulness was positively associated with all outcomes for the clinical group only. Social interaction frequency had little influence on out- comes. Depressive symptom severity was positively associated with all out- comes, whereas anxiety was negatively associated with prosocial behavior. Discussion: These findings highlight how social engagement was experienced early in the U.S. COVID-19 crisis.
